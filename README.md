# ChatGPT-Creations
Some of the stuff I got OpenAI's ChatGPT to generate, sometimes merely for fun.

If a program is broken/wrong, I will not fix it. It is how the AI generated it, and it will stay as it is unless I ask ChatGPT to fix it by itself.

Also I can't really put up the queries I use to generate the codes since they are almost never single queries but usually a set of sequential queries, which may or may not involve silly fights in between because the bloody thing apparently only skim-reads articles and I have to go like "In your last reply, you said/did ______. Check if this is really true." and it goes like "Oh sorry that was an error, whoops, lemme try that again boss."
